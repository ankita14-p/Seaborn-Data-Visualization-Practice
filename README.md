# Seaborn-Data-Visualization-Practice
This repository contains my hands-on practice and learning notes from the Seaborn library for data visualization. I explored essential functions like scatter plots, bar plots, count plots, distribution plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices using built-in Seaborn datasets in Google Colab.
